1.     What a successful residency would look like to me (bigger picture)

KC: Support a successful partnership between AM and HR

AM: Develop something new, learn something new. Share things and understanding. Explore what people think vs. reality and the relationships between people. Data ethnography. Programming to explore human aspects of what data could mean. Learn – code – share.

HR: AM achieving the R+D, no pressure of a final outcome. A culture of exchange. Thought leadership/disruption. For AM to keep staff challenging their assumptions. Move away from 1984-esque big brother data narrative.

2.     How will that work (practicalities and details)

HR: Art programme is forward facing and marketing opp. AM new work to go in exhibition with working title “Something given”. AM to co-curate something for the office, lunchtime lecture that serve AM’s research/reference it. Involve the staff in something you create.

AM: Also working on Pledge Music campaign with SaM. Fridays are a good day to be in the office. Project in Cornwall as well. Wrapping up teaching. Performance 29th April, Leeds at ODI node. Deadlines are good!

Feb – May = research
Jun – Aug = Prototyping
Sept – Nov = Dissemination

Office exhibition in May (TBC)

3.     Mentoring
AM to think about and then let KC know. Rich might me able to help with suggestions too.

4.     Communicating the residency to audiences
